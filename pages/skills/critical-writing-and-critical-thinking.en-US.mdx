# Critical Writing and Critical Thinking

In academic writing, Critical Writing and Critical Thinking are two closely connected concepts. Critical writing is based on critical thinking and requires the author to propose their own arguments while reflecting on others' viewpoints. This means that the author is not merely stating facts or describing events, but conducting an in-depth analysis and evaluation of the texts they read, guiding their own thinking through critical reading.

## Non-critical Reading and Critical Reading

### Non-critical Reading

Non-critical reading focuses on information acquisition. Readers under this mode are usually focused on understanding the surface information, ideas, and viewpoints of the text. It applies to many situations in our daily life, such as reading weather reports. In these situations, information acquisition is the primary purpose, rather than analyzing or questioning its accuracy.

### Critical Reading

Critical reading goes deeper, aiming to form personal insights by analyzing the structure, arguments, evidence, etc., of the text. Critical reading is not merely about the simple acceptance of information but evaluates its validity, origin, and argumentation process. Through critical reading, readers can identify and evaluate the core claims of the text and understand how the author supports these claims through reasoning and evidence.

The key steps of critical reading include:

1. **Identifying the text's claims**: Determine the author's main arguments and evaluate how these claims are developed and argued.
2. **Analyse the context**: Understand the background of the text, the target audience, and its relevant historical background.
3. **Identify the way of reasoning**: Analyse how the author defines and uses concepts and how they use theories or methods to interpret data.
4. **Evaluating evidence**: Examine the supportive evidence provided by the author and analyze its validity and source.
5. **Make an evaluation**: Critical reading may also involve evaluating the pros and cons of an argument, helping the reader form their own judgment.

## Why do Critical Reading?

Critical reading is the foundation of academic writing. It helps us not only understand others' viewpoints but also develop our own arguments. When undertaking critical reading, it usually requires multiple readings of the same article, each time focusing on different aspects. The first time might be just to understand the author's main points, while subsequent readings would focus more on the argument method, evidence, and conclusions drawn.

Critical reading helps us avoid being passive recipients of knowledge, instead developing our own analytical framework through analysis and questioning of the text.

## Steps of Critical Writing

The purpose of critical writing is to propose independent insights in academic discussions. Here are some important steps of critical writing:

1. **Adopt a critical stance**: Every text, author, and argument has a specific perspective. The author needs to recognize the existence of these perspectives and develop their arguments by analyzing these viewpoints.
2. **Pay close attention to details**: Pay attention to the evidence, examples, language, and structure used in the text, evaluate how the author supports their argument using these elements.
3. **See the big picture**: Analyze the text in context. Understanding the historical background, writing purpose, and target audience of the text can help the author better critically analyze the material.
4. **Engage in it**: Critical writing is not just a response to others' viewpoints, but also includes proposing one's insights. By combining personal experiences and analyses, the author can develop compelling arguments and provide unique perspectives in discussions.

## Summary

Critical writing and critical thinking compose important parts of academic writing. Through critical reading, authors can deeply understand the text, assess the validity of arguments, and develop their own insights. Critical writing, based on this, proposes independent and powerful arguments supported by logic and evidence. The ultimate purpose of academic writing is to contribute new perspectives based on existing knowledge; therefore, critical thinking and writing skills are crucial.
