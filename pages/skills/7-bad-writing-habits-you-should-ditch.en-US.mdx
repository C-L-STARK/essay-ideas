# Guide to Essay Writing

Essay writing can be likened to baking bread or assembling Lego. Beginners need to follow certain steps and rules to create their ideal work. For beginners, knowing which writing processes are correct and which ones to avoid is critical. Once you have accumulated some experience, you can innovate on the basis of the rules to make your work stand out.

In this article, we will look at seven common bad habits to avoid in essay writing.

## 1. Avoid Unnecessary Abbreviations

Using abbreviations can make the article seem less formal. Although abbreviations are common in modern language, in academic writing, especially when it comes to proper nouns and important academic content, one should try to avoid using abbreviations to maintain the article's professionalism.

## 2. Avoid Ending with Prepositions

When a sentence ends with a preposition, it may appear less formal. While in some situations, it can make the sentence more fluent, in academic writing, such a structure should generally be avoided. Read out the sentence aloud to judge if it is appropriate.

## 3. Avoid Starting Sentences with "and" or "but"

Beginning sentences with "and" or "but" may lead to incomplete sentences. When using these conjunctions, ensure that the sentence is complete and structured correctly, otherwise their use should be avoided.

## 4. Use Passive Voice with Caution

The active voice is usually the preferred choice in academic writing because it is more direct and clearer. Although the passive voice is appropriate in some situations, it must be used cautiously.

## 5. Avoid Splitting Infinitives

Splitting infinitives should generally be avoided in academic writing. Maintaining the integrity of the infinitive can help improve the professionalism and readability of the article.

## 6. Avoid One-Sentence Paragraphs

In academic writing, a paragraph usually should contain multiple sentences to fully develop an argument. One-sentence paragraphs might not seem comprehensive enough, especially in formal academic papers.

## 7. Avoid One-Word Sentences

One-word sentences are less common in formal essays. To maintain sentence variety and reader interest, long and short sentences should be used in combination.

By following these guidelines, you can improve the quality and professionalism of your essays. We hope these suggestions will help you achieve better results in your academic writing.
